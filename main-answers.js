// 3. Imagine you are writing a Gradebook program. Create a class named Student which encapsulates the following 
//data: student first name, student last name student ID. You may use pseudoclassical or ES6 syntax.

// 4. Still within the context of the Gradebook program, create a class named Assignment which encapsulates the following 
//data: a student ID, a url link to the assignment submission, an assignment type 
//(homework, classwork, etc), and a grade. You may use pseudoclassical or ES6 syntax.

// 6. Add an instance method to your Gradebook class which is called addAssignment and receives an assignment parameter, 
// then adds it to the Gradebook's internal array which stores Assignments.



class Student{
    constructor(students){
        this.student.first = student.first;
        this.student.last = student.last;
        this.student.ID = student.ID;
    }
}

class Assignment{
    constructor(assignments){
        youth = new Student()
        this.student.ID = youth.student.ID
        this.url = assignments.url
        this.type = assignments.type
        this.grade = assignments.grade

// 8. What is node.js?
It is a javascript run-time environment that is open source and cross-platform

// 9. What is an example of the usage of an http session? In other words, what are http sessions for?
An example is when you have a user login and you need that person to login only 
once. You want the person to be able to access other pages for which he/she has been given access without having to 
sign-in each time. By creating a session, you are able to keep the person logged in and able to access the locations you have
set for him/her to access.
